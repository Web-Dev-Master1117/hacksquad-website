Contribute code as a team, meet community members, participate in workshops, and win SWAG
</h3>

With the fantastic atmosphere of Hacktoberfest, we have decided to create Hacksquad. Hacksquad is here to enhance your **Swag**, meet with more community members and participate in workshops from our great sponsors.

HackSquad allows contributors to contribute code **as a team** instead of a single contributor. Engage the community in a friendly competition over the month of October.

Register to the HackSquad using your GitHub, Join a team or get assigned to a **random team**. Each day we will calculate every team member approved PR and sum them all together. By the end of the event, the top 300 teams will win awesome swag!
